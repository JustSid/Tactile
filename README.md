Pebble Watchface made for /u/madmax1345 on Reddit after he made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/2nwhcd/face_tactile_style_watch_face_request_very_crude/) thread.

## Configuration

There are two things that can be configured at build time, AM/PM indicator and White-on-Black vs Black-on-White. The defines for that are in main.c, but can also be passed to the compiler (`AMPM_INDICATOR` and `WHITE_ON_BLACK`, both default to `1`)
